# USDX

USDX is a custom MT4/MT5 indicator coded by EarnForex.com. The indicator is based on the formula for the ICE's dollar index. It requires the following currency pairs to work: EUR/USD, USD/JPY, GBP/USD, USD/CAD, USD/CHF, and USD/SEK.

THe MT4 version displays the indicator as a line (you choose which price type to use for the line; the default one is Close). The MT5 version displays the indicator as Japanese candlesticks. Both versions can apply moving averages to the display.
